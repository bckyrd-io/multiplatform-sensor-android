# Mobile App Development Assignment

## Task 1: Understanding the Scope and Position of Mobile Apps (15 Marks)

### a) Key Characteristics of Mobile Apps (600 words)

**Offline Accessibility**
The fitness tracking app implements robust offline functionality through local data storage. When users perform activities like running, cycling, or weightlifting without an internet connection, their workout data is stored locally in Room Database. The app uses a sophisticated synchronization mechanism that automatically detects network availability and syncs data in the background. This is particularly useful for users in remote areas or during workouts where mobile data might be unavailable.

**Push Notifications**
The Goal class in the app supports a comprehensive notification system that enhances user engagement and motivation. Users can set various types of fitness goals (steps, calories, distance) with specific target values and timeframes. The notification system is implemented using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and includes:
- Daily reminders to log activities
- Progress updates when users reach 50%, 75%, and 100% of their goals
- Achievement notifications for completing goals
- Weekly summaries of progress

**Touch-Based Interface**
The app utilizes Jetpack Compose's Material3 design system to create an intuitive and responsive touch interface. Key features include:
- Swipe gestures for navigating between different workout types
- Long press actions for quick workout logging
- Pinch-to-zoom for detailed activity charts
- Drag-and-drop functionality for organizing workout routines
- Voice commands integration using Android's Speech Recognition API

- Advanced biometric monitoring (heart rate, VO2 max)
- Integration with wearable devices (smartwatches, fitness bands)
- Social features for community challenges
- Personalized workout recommendations using machine learning
- Integration with healthcare systems for medical-grade tracking

**Limitations and Solutions**
The app addresses common mobile app limitations through:
- Adaptive UI for different screen sizes using Jetpack Compose's responsive layouts

## Task 5: Employing Object-Oriented Techniques (15 Marks)

### a) Object Orientation in Kotlin (300 words)

**Encapsulation**
```kotlin
class Workout(
    private var id: String = "",
    private var name: String = "",
    private var exercises: List<Exercise> = emptyList()
) {
    fun getName(): String = name
    fun setName(value: String) { name = value }
    fun getExercises(): List<Exercise> = exercises
    fun setExercises(value: List<Exercise>) { exercises = value }
}
```

**Inheritance**
```kotlin
open class Exercise(
    private var id: String = "",
    private var name: String = "",
    private var duration: Int = 0
) {
    fun calculateCalories(): Double {
        return duration * 0.5  // Base formula
    }
}

class RunningExercise(
    id: String = "",
    name: String = "Running",
    duration: Int = 0,
    private var pace: Double = 0.0
) : Exercise(id, name, duration) {
    override fun calculateCalories(): Double {
        return super.calculateCalories() * 1.2  // Running-specific formula
    }
}
```

**Polymorphism**
```kotlin
fun processExercise(exercise: Exercise) {
    val calories = exercise.calculateCalories()
    // Polymorphic behavior based on exercise type
}

processExercise(RunningExercise())  // Calls RunningExercise's implementation
processExercise(CyclingExercise())  // Calls CyclingExercise's implementation
```

### b) Inheritance Usage (400 words)

**Exercise Hierarchy**
```kotlin
// Base class
open class Exercise(
    private var id: String = "",
    private var name: String = "",
    private var duration: Int = 0
) {
    open fun calculateCalories(): Double {
        return duration * 0.5
    }
}

// Inherited classes
class RunningExercise(...) : Exercise(...) {
    override fun calculateCalories(): Double {
        return super.calculateCalories() * 1.2
    }
}

class CyclingExercise(...) : Exercise(...) {
    override fun calculateCalories(): Double {
        return super.calculateCalories() * 1.5
    }
}
```

**Goal Types**
```kotlin
class Goal(
    private var type: GoalType = GoalType.STEPS,
    private var targetValue: Int = 0,
    private var currentValue: Int = 0
) {
    fun checkProgress(): Boolean {
        return currentValue >= targetValue
    }
}

enum class GoalType {
    STEPS,
    CALORIES,
    DISTANCE
}
```

**Workout Composition**
```kotlin
class Workout(
    private var id: String = "",
    private var exercises: List<Exercise> = emptyList()
) {
    fun addExercise(exercise: Exercise) {
        exercises = exercises + exercise
    }
    
    fun getTotalCalories(): Double {
        return exercises.sumOf { it.calculateCalories() }
    }
}
```
